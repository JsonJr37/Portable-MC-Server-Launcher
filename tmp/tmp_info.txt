This is where the "latest" launches of the corresponding files are stored, the temporary starting files that run the server with the correct java set.

The bat_inject.txt file is what code gets injected into the starter bat files
The default_bat_inject.txt is the default injecting file layout

For making your own bat_inject.txt file:
Variables to pay attention to when making your own bat inject file:
 - %BAT% is the path to the bat file
 - %SERVER_PATH% is the location of the server folder
 - %SELECTED_SERVER% is the selected server
 - %SERVER_DIR% is the server data folder

Last notes:
You NEED to keep at least the default_bat_inject.txt stuff, because you need to set java, and this is bare minimum

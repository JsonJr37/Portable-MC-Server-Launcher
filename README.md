# Portable Minecraft Server Launcher
 I have made this project because I wanted to make a portable server launcher for minecraft.
 It hase Graphical Elemets, and a server installer that I have made.

## Requirements
 - A portable Java JDK, would recommend <https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases>
 - Windows 10/11

## How to Setup
 1. Download the Repository / Latest Release
 2. Extract the Java you downloaded into the "java" folder
 3. Then double-click "main.bat", and your done!

# Extras
These are the extras, which contain server compatabilities and what the other files do

## Compatabilities
### List of servers it can run
  - Vanilla
  - Paper
  - Fabric
  - NeoForge - will need to setup manually
### List of servers it cannot run
  - anything without run.bat / start.bat
### Untested Servers
 The rest of the ones you don't see, and to check if it will work, just needs a start.bat / run.bat that leads to the Jar file.

## Other
### launch-all.bat
 This does what it says, launches all of the servers in the server folder.</br>
 Mainly, I made this for launching Proxy Servers. To see how to make one, [click here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdFlDZtCTjI)</br>
